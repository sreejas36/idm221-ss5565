        <!--put a picture!!-->
        <p>
            I’m an inquisitive student excited to make valuable contributions to a collaborative team. I’m eager to harness my creative problem-solving skills and meticulous attention to detail in order to create meaningful digital experiences.

            Though I’m in Philadelphia for school, I call northern New Jersey my home. Since I yearn to travel, going between these has been really enjoyable!

            I enjoy photography and reading in my free time, as both have helped me increase my skills. Through photography, I see more of the big picture and how details are essential to showcase certain moods. Reading allows me to delve into people, learning more about their backgrounds and how they work and solve problems, fictional and nonfictional. Both aspects are essential in the UX and UI field since they involve learning about people and empathizing with their lives; capturing detail to create the best possible interface for clients.

            <h3>My Journey to UXID</h3>
                <p>
                    Coming to Drexel, I applied to the First-Year Exploratory Studies Program as I was still a bit undecided as to what I should major in. Through the program, I got the opportunity to explore two of my desired majors at the time, Computer Science and Biomedical Engineering. I would be able to combine my interests in technology and the medical field bridging my love for engineering and practical design. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    They were extremely rewarding, and I greatly liked them for different reasons. Computer Science allowed me to learn skills such as coding and researching to create something solely on my own. Biomedical Engineering allowed me to work in a collaborative team to solve issues on a greater world scale. I realized that I loved to collaborate and work with others to come to a common goal, combining research with creation due to the engineering design process. The opportunity to design for people to improve their quality of life was something I wanted to address in my future career.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My road to exploration wasn’t finished with these two, however. I knew that aside from Computer Science and BME, there was another major that would be the perfect blend of what I desired. This was how I found out about User Experience and Interaction Design!
                </p>
                <p>
                    UXID was the perfect blend of learning skills related to computer science and tech and also working towards a bigger idea collaboratively like in biomedical engineering. It also opened up a bigger picture for me.
                    As a multipotentialite, UXID’s combination of technology, design, psychology, and overall was really interesting to me, and I enjoy learning more about the subject. I love that it gives me the flexibility to learn various disciplines and become well-versed in various aspects of the world.
                </p>
                <p>I appreciate my journey through these different fields because they gave me a taste of what I like and want to give to the people around me!</p>
