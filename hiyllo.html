        <h3 class="title">Intro</h3>
            <p>
                Since August of 2023, I’ve been working as a Design Intern at the startup company Hiyllo, which focuses on creating platforms for individuals, businesses, entrepreneurs, and creators. As we are still in the launch phase, my designs are confidential and I cannot share them just yet. Nevertheless, here is my journey through being a Design Intern! 
            </p>
        <h3 class="title">Reflection</h3>
            <p>
            As an intern, I’ve gained valuable experience regarding not only design but also how to perform in a company setting. Here, I’m making the most of being a part of a team that collaborates, ideates, and provides feedback for our services. It’s been interesting to learn how a company has started and continues to create.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my time at Hiyllo, I’ve adapted to various changes and improvements. Since not everything had been set in stone, a lot of my takeaways were related to how I’ve personally grown and improved, changing my outlook and getting accustomed to an ever-changing environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’ve learned to use UX Pin, a designing software similar to Figma, to create wireframes and mockups dedicated to Hiyllo. Using Figma in classes and UX Pin at Hiyllo meant that I could make connections between both softwares and bridge my understanding between them. As we are developing a workspace at Hiyllo, my job has centered around improving the design and integrating features that will enhance the user’s experience seamlessly. We’ve improved the app through updates, and it’s cool to see it grow and progress. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I get excited when I can connect concepts I learn to the real world. Studying UXID and simultaneously being able to expand on it by applying it to prototypes for Hiyllo was valuable to me. I made meaningful contributions to our design process, helping those not familiar with UX and UI concepts to learn as well. I’ve been able to experience how my education directly impacts my performance at the corporate level and see the various ways a company works to develop projects and optimize collaboration.
