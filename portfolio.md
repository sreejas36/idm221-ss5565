# Hi, I'm Sreeja!
## I'm an aspiring User Experience and Interaction Design student currently in my sophomore year at Drexel University.

# About [#about]

I’m also an Honors student at Pennoni Honors College! I look forward to expanding my knowledge of this interdisciplinary field through collaboration and innovation!

Though I’m in Philadelphia for school, I call northern New Jersey my home. I hope to use this to branch out to various locations, from Philadelphia to New York City. 

I enjoy photography and reading in my free time, as both have helped me increase my skills. Through photography, I see more of the big picture and how details are essential to showcase certain moods. Reading allows me to delve into people, learning more about their backgrounds and how they work and solve problems, fictional and nonfictional. Both aspects are essential in the UX and UI field since they involve learning about people and how they work, and capturing detail to create the best possible interface for clients.

## Hiyllo


### Process
Since August, I’ve been working as a Design Intern at the startup company Hiyllo, which focuses on creating platforms for individuals, businesses, entrepreneurs, and creators. 
### Reflection
As an intern, I’ve gained valuable experience regarding not only design but also how a collaborative company works. As we are in the start-up stage, I’m making the most of being a part of a company of creators who collaborate, ideate, and provide feedback for our services. I am looking to expand on this internship with the knowledge I will get through my studies, and I hope to learn more about the various ways a company works and develops projects to optimize collaboration. 

## Design/School Projects
### Web 2.0 Redesign for IDM 101
I redesigned Spotify and created the browser interface on Figma for the first time. I liked using the styles and components to make different shapes and icons with it! It was a refreshing challenge to use my reference image and design my own version of the Netscape browser, I'm proud of how it came out, though I would invest more in learning and creating my own designs using Figma and the like.

### Lotus Pictorial Space Storyboard
For VSST 108, our final projects involved creating a story with an alternate universe and bringing it to life by combining different pictures and elements on Photoshop and Illustrator. The project emphasized monotone black and white, and having a proper foreground, middle ground, and background to create a seamless image. It was important to think about shading and other design elements, like Atmospheric diminution, and how that plays a part in a proper landscape. To create this. I combined the images of cities, gardens, fountains, lotus flowers, and the girl by using different tools to isolate the original images and put certain elements into the picture. I created the floating lotus element was created on Photoshop by creating the crystal shapes and using shading techniques to integrate it with the pictorial space. The geometric lotus was painted as part of the final project presentation.

### Sunrise Stool Set for PROD 215
For this Product Design project, we were tasked with picking a mythological creature and drawing a common household object at random to create a product that embodied the qualities of the creature. I picked a phoenix, and my object was a stool. It was challenging to think of a way a flying, free phoenix would embody a grounded stool. However, through our ideation process, I was able to form connections between the messages and ideas that phoenixes portrayed, and how stools not only represented a seat, but a simple tool used in places of communication. The idea of communication and the symbolism that could be attributed to the phoenix made it a fun idea to make interlocking stools that stood for a greater purpose of hope and inspiration. I enjoyed this project a lot, from researching how stools and phoenixes came to be important, ideating, creating storyboards, sketching out various ideas, and building up my product. It was nice to see it through from start to finish, as I could see exactly which steps, I took to create this stool set from start to finish!

### Dragon Venture: PROD 215 Final Design Project
This was the final group project for PROD 215, and it was challenging, but also extremely rewarding. Our final project had two components: a main product, as well as a digital component, like an app. The projects had to be tied to a social group that we were either a part of or dealt with a lot. We formed groups by the class thinking of 3 ideas individually and narrowing them down to the type of problem it encompassed, such as social, environmental, organizational, etc.
Drexel is made up largely of commuter students, and since many of my friends are commuters and struggle with different aspects of getting to campus or have much more on their plate, I decided to focus on helping commuter students. My group members and I focused on how we could relieve some stress related to the commuter lifestyle, by maximizing the space and tools they could use to make their experiences at Drexel better. We did a lot of research, ideation, and prototype designing to come to our final product. We decided that our product, Dragon Venture, would have 3 components; a locker, a lounge, and an app that would work interconnected. The locker would be specifically designed for commuters to fit large objects, clothing, and food into as well as a tablet interface to connect to the app. The lounge would be an area dedicated for commuter students to rest, recharge, and study. The app would be an all-in-one hub, where individual students can check their schedules, connect to the interface on their locker, and have a quicker way of seeing transportation routes and updates all in one place. It would also have a messaging component to help them connect with other commuters in the same situation and ways for them to learn about and keep in touch with organizations on campus. I created the blueprint for the lounge and worked with one of my team members to create the app on Figma. From start to finish, this project took a lot of planning, care, and discussion, but we were able to deliver a solid presentation about an issue prevalent in Drexel. Overall, I'm very proud of our idea and the work we put into it, and I'm hoping that my group and I will be able to continue this and fully implement it at Drexel.

## Creative Work
PHTO 110: Film Photography Assignment
Through a happy accident in the Winter Term of my Freshman Year, I was placed in the major specific photography course and received the opportunity to work with film cameras in the darkroom. It was an incredible experience, and I really cherished the time I got to explore photography through a historical camera. We utilized a Hasselblad camera, and got the opportunity to learn design techniques, shoot 2 rolls of film depicting those techniques, and develop those photos throughout the term. Even though I felt out of place at first, I was able to delve into my interest in photography and transition from digital photography on my phone to a completely analog experience. 
Being part of that photography class helped me realize that I really did appreciate photography. It wasn’t just a simple hobby, as I started out with. It became more intentional, and I was able to not only capture what was in front of me, but also my growth and personality through what I decided to portray.
Photography is a tool I cherish, as someone who was very shy growing up. It was my way of communicating, and now I’m delving into more photography, with a digital camera. I hope to increase my repertoire of knowledge so that I can learn more professional skills as time goes on.
